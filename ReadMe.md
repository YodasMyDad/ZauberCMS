# ZauberCMS - The Blazor CMS

### I'm working to get ZauberCMS to a v1 release candidate very soon

ZauberCMS is a CMS built on **Blazor**. The admin is built using InteractiveServer and 
the front end (Your website) is built using the [new static rendering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes?view=aspnetcore-8.0) (But you can build it in Server or WASM if you want). The CMS is [inspired by Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/), and follows many of the 
same concepts.

I wanted a CMS that was aimed towards .Net Developers who wanted to use Blazor and also a CMS that is easily extendable and customisable without 
having to learn a front end framework. Anyone that has Blazor experience and is interested in getting involved, [please contact me on X](https://twitter.com/YodasMyDad)

_Core tech used is: .Net 8, Blazor, EF Core, Identity, Mediatr, [Radzen Components](https://www.radzen.com/blazor-components/)_

## Getting Started

Fastest way to get started is using the Nuget package, full instructions on how to use it are below (Dotnet template coming with v1 RC1)

## Starter Site Build

The video below shows the starter site being built. It covers building a site from nothing, to complete finished site. If you have never used Umbraco 
then I highly recommend watching it as it covers a lot of concepts.
