# ZauberCMS (.NET CMS)
## The Best Of Both Worlds

ZauberCMS is a fully featured CMS built in **.NET 9 (Using Blazor & .NET MVC)**. The CMS is inspired by Umbraco, and follows a number of similar concepts.

I built this CMS to allow .NET developers to continue building websites just as they always have - with traditional .NET MVC - while also offering a modern, highly customizable, interactive CMS editing experience powered by Blazor (Can also be used on the front end too!).

The goal is simple: a CMS that’s super easy to extend, highly modular, and doesn’t require learning a front-end framework or dealing with complex build tools. With Blazor, customization is quick, straightforward and developer-friendly.

_Core tech used is: .Net 9, Blazor, EF Core, Identity, Mediatr, [Radzen Components](https://www.radzen.com/blazor-components/)_

## Getting Started

This repo comes with a starter site example, if you clone this repo, build and run the **ZauberCMS.Web** project you will see the starter kit (Go to /admin, register an account to see everything).

However, fastest way to get started building your own website is using the .Net Template, firstly install the ZauberCMS template (--force just makes sure you install the latest one)

```ps
# Ensure we have the latest ZauberCMS templates
dotnet new install ZauberCMS.Template --force

# Create your CMS
dotnet new zaubercms -n "YourSiteName"
```

You can also use Nuget and full instructions on how to use it are below
